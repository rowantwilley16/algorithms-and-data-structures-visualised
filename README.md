**Maze Generator -** This script implements a maze generation algorithm using the depth-first search algorithm. The main data structures driving the algorithm are the list (grid_cells) representing the maze's grid cells and the stack (stack) used for backtracking during the depth-first search algorithm. The dictionary (walls) within each Cell object stores information about the walls surrounding that cell.
